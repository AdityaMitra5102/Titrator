# Titrator
Automated Titration Machine

Fix the servo at 0 degrees to the closed burette so that when it is at 90 degrees, the burette is opened.

Works with Acid/Base titration and Oxidation/Reduction titration.

The loose ending of the wires go into the conical flask.

Do not read the resistance marked on the digram. Use a 220 Ohm one.
